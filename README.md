# bob-webinterface

## Introduction

This is a demo webinterface for the BOB project build with VueJS.
To test it set up a FiPy with the [demo webserver](https://github.com/vkuhlen/bob-webserver-demo). Rename `.env.example` to `.env` and add the URL of your FiPy.
If you are in the same LAN as your FiPy it should be available under the hostname 'http://espressif.lan'.
